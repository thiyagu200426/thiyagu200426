## 🚀 About Me

I'm a results-oriented Python developer with a strong background in back-end and full stack application development. I specialize in building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solutions using Django, React, and MySQL. My passion lies in developing AI-powered applications and exploring cutting-edge technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and API integrations (OpenAI, Hugging Face).

Currently, I'm diving deep into NLP, LLMs, and prompt engineering to create smarter, more responsive tools.
